It is a simple paint in the Java language , I did in September 2015 by pastime when I was in time of holidays ( I worked in the same time in order to save money).

The app is in this folder , the name is "PaintApp.jar"
To run it you have to install the Java Platform


In this app you can:
- draw , change the shape or the color of the pen
- change the background (Black or White)
- Erase all your paint or use the eraser
- save your picture where you want on your computer , the format will be JPEG
